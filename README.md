This was my first ever mod, and had to be decompiled after I lost the source (thank you Griffin!), thus the inconsistent filenames and extensive to-do list.

## Installation

Compile the text files using *gc.exe* that ships with the game. Place the compiled *script.lgs* and the *gfx* and *sfx* directories in a subfolder in your Liero Xtreme directory.

## To Do

### General Improvements

 - Add weapons from newer Ratchet & Clank games
 - Make more projectiles shake the screen
 - Ensure similar weapons are suitably different
 - Lower explosion values over 15

### Specific Weapons
 
 - Annihilator - Shrapnel gets caught in rock
 - Bolts - Use sparks on hit (from wrench)
 - Bouncer - Goes too far with odd gravity, needs damage delays, explode on PlayerHit
 - Clank Zapper - Workings are slightly odd
 - Devastator - Acceleration needs lowering, needs damage delays
 - Drone Device - Make them more like they are in the game?
 - Glove of Doom - Needs damage delays
 - Gravity Bomb - Has black dots for explosions, should be more nuke-shaped?
 - Infector - Needs damage delays
 - Miniturret - No need for greenball (see Guided Arrow from Diablo mod)
    - Fewer, faster shots
    - Keeps firing after it's gone
 - Nitro Launcher - Doesn't explode on hit, needs damage delays, has invisible explosion
 - Nanotech - Goes too far with little gravity
 - Plasma Coil - Needs damage delays
 - Protopet - Needs damage delays
 - Seeker Gun - Always goes right
 - Shield Charger - Has gaps and carves dirt (change to greenball)
 - Sonic Summoner - Use same bullet file
 - Tesla Claw - More lightning-like?
 - Wrench (Hack) / Wrench (Throw) - Use same spark file

### Rebalancing

 - Nerf:
    - Banana Gun

    - Rifles
    - RYNOs
